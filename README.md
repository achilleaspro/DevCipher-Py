# DevCipher-Py

**DevCipher-Py** is a Python implementation of the Affine Cipher, a classic cryptographic algorithm. It provides functions for encryption, decryption, and key validation, allowing users to secure messages through programming.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Convert plaintext messages to ciphertext using the Affine Cipher formula.
- **Decryption:** Recover the original message from ciphertext using the inverse of the Affine Cipher formula.
- **Key Validation:** Ensure that provided keys meet the necessary criteria for secure encryption and decryption.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DevCipher-Py.git
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python devcipher.py
   ```

3. Choose encryption (enter 1) or decryption (enter 2) mode, input keys, and provide the required text.

## Example

```bash
Enter 1 to encrypt or 2 to decrypt: 1
Enter the value of A: 3
Enter the value of B: 7
Enter the plaintext: Hello
The ciphertext is:  OVSSV

...

```
